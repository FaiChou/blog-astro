```
when I came to town,
all I saw was trash on the ground,
drunks pooping on the street,
parking tickets on my windshield,
I wanted to leave,
but a part of me needed to stay and face the fear,
they broke into my car,
stole everything but my guitar,
and the police didn't care,
nothing in this town seemed to be fair,
I wanted to leave,
but a part of me needed to beat the fear,
I don't care if it's right or wrong,
but I've grown to ignore,
now I just don't care anymore,
well I'm still in town,
I've made some friends and I have found,
some sort of peace,
among the concrete there are trees,
and now I believe,
I can pick and chose in life what I would like to see,
I just don't care,
in a good way anymore.
