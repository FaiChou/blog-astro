## slash or not `SRC/` vs `SRC`

```
$ tree dir1
dir1
├── bar
└── foo
    └── README

$ rsync -a dir1 dir_bk
$ tree dir_bk
dir_bk
└── dir1
    ├── bar
    └── foo
        └── README

$ rm -rf dir_bk && mkdir dir_bk
$ rsync -a dir1/ dir_bk
$ tree dir_bk
dir_bk
├── bar
└── foo
    └── README
```

Without a slash on the source directory means copy both the source directory, and the contents (recursively if specified) to the destination directory while adding a trailing slash means only copy the contents of the source directory, recursively if specified, to the destination.


There’s no difference on the `DES`. A slash on the destination directory appears to have no effect.
